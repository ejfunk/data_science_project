This was a project for the MAT 311 Intro to Data Science Class.

The benefits I found to using AI in this project were mainly related to time. It saved me time to not have to type out repeated functions and processes. I also saved time not having to hunt down typos, as the 
model was much less likely to make typo errors than I am. It was also interesting to see how the AI might have solved a probelm in a different way than I would have, furthering my knowledge.
Finally, the AI had the knowledge of all of the documentation, saving me time in having to look up functions I don't use as often. 

Although there were some benefits, the negatives of this cannot be forgotten either. First, since I knew the output I was trying to get, sometimes for basic functions I knew how to do the time it took to 
tweak the model outputs was longer than just me doing it myself. Of course, there is also the risk of logical errors as well, which would add even more time to identify and fix. Another risk that is run is when
finding those errors is that when you're using AI is much harder, because often you do not have a full understanding of what the AI is doing. The lack of understanding is the biggest issue of AI.

Looking at the outputs what the best way to verify that what I was doing was correct. Since I also had a pretty good idea of how the code and functions were running, I was also able to step through teh AI generated codes
logically.
